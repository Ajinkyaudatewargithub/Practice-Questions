Given a N X N binary Square Matrix where each row and column of the matrix is sorted in ascending order. Find the total number of zeros present in the matrix.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
A = {{0, 0, 0},
     {0, 0, 1},
     {0, 1, 1}}
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The first, second and third row contains 3, 2 and 1
zeroes respectively.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
A = {{1, 1},
     {1, 1}}
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no zeroes in any of the rows.

def countZeroes(A):
    count = 0
    for i in A:
       for j in i:
            if j == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)
# countZeroes([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]])

Given N bits to an XOR - Gate find the output that will be produced. 
XOR - Gate Table:
1 ^ 1 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
0 ^ 1 = 1
0 ^ 0 = 0
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr: 1 1 1 0
Output:
1
Explanation:
1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
hence output is 1

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr: 0 0 1 0
Output:
1
Explanation:
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
hence output is 1

HINT : If the number of 1s are even then the answer is 0, otherwise answer is 1.
